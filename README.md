Implement machine learning to find optimal parameters in social dynamics model

MOTIVATION

  1.In a small indoor area such as classroom or office, human behaviors are most driven by social interactions (i.e., communication, gestures, eye contacts)

  2.Those behaviors can be described theoretically  if we can come up with a model that can well capture and quantify those abstract social interactions

  3.The model should be developed based on real observed data

  4.The best parameters that fit the real data might be obtained if we can implement inverse statistical method (Machine Learning) in some descent manner
